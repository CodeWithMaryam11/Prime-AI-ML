#QNO1-SOLUTION:
with open("names.txt", "w") as f:
    #Writes 5 names entered by the user
    for i in range(5):
        name = input(f"Enter name {i+1}: ")
        f.write(name + "\n") 
#Opens the same file in read mode and prints all names
with open("names.txt", "r") as f: 
    print("\nNames in file:")
    print(f.read())


#QNO2-SOLUTION:
with open("sample.txt", "a") as f: 
    #Adds a new log entry
    f.write("Program run successfully\n") 
#Opens the file in read mode and prints all logs
with open("sample.txt", "r") as f: 
    print("Log History:")
    print(f.read()) 


#QNO3-SOLUTION:
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] 
#List comprehension to keep only numbers greater than 15
new_list = [x for x in numbers if x > 15]
print(new_list) 


#QNO4-SOLUTION:
import json

    "New York": 8419000,
    "Tokyo": 13960000,
    "Paris": 2148000

#Update this info in the JSON file
data[new_city] = new_pop # Update the dictionary in memory
with open("cities.json", "w") as f:

#Load the file again and print the FINAL updated list

    final_data = json.load(f) 
    for city, pop in final_data.items():

#QNO5-SOLUTION:
# Try to open "data.txt" in read mode
try:
    with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
        print(f.read())
# Catch the exception if the file doesn't exist
