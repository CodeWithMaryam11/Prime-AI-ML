# Prime-AI-ML

This repository contains my structured learning work from the Prime AI/ML program.  
It is focused on concept-building, hands-on assignments, and practice implementations across core AI, Machine Learning, and Generative AI topics.

## Contents

The repository is organized module-wise to reflect a progressive learning path:

### Python & Data Fundamentals
- Core Python programming
- Data structures and control flow
- Functions, OOP concepts
- File handling and JSON
- Data preprocessing and visualization  
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Machine Learning
- Mathematics for AI (statistics, probability basics)
- Supervised learning (regression, classification)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Core algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, K-Means, PCA
- Model evaluation metrics and bias–variance concepts
- Hands-on implementations using Scikit-learn

### Deep Learning
- Neural network fundamentals
- Forward and backward propagation
- Perceptron and feedforward networks
- CNN, RNN, and LSTM architectures
- Introduction to Transformers
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch

### Generative AI & NLP
- Natural Language Processing basics
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Generative models including GANs
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agentic AI concepts
- Working with OpenAI APIs and AI tools

### AI Engineering Basics
- SQL for data handling
- Git & GitHub version control
- Flask for AI-based applications

## Purpose of This Repository
- To document my AI/ML learning journey
- To practice concepts through assignments and code implementations
- To build a strong conceptual and practical foundation in AI and ML

> Note: This repository is dedicated to learning and assignments.  
> Standalone projects are maintained separately.
